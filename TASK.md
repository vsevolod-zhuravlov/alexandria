# Decentralized System for Confirming Student Achievements

## Problem

In traditional student projects and educational programs, it is difficult to confirm the contribution of each participant, the transparency of assessment, and the fair distribution of achievements. Centralized solutions depend on team leaders, which can lead to bias or manipulation. The use of blockchain allows for the provision of openness and reliability of information about completed tasks and student achievements.

## Description

Develop a blockchain-based platform that allows students to confirm the completion of tasks, while teachers or independent experts verify these achievements. The main goal is to provide an automated, transparent system for accounting student successes.


## Basic functional requirements

### 1. **Registration and management of participants*
   - Authorization through MetaMask or a similar crypto wallet
   - Registration of the project and participants in the smart contract. The process includes two levels of interaction
   - Teachers or other independent experts create projects, define participation conditions, set access (open or by list), establish rewards, deadlines, and additional persons for confirmation of completion
   - Students submit applications through the contract and receive confirmation of completion according to the specified rules.

### 2. **Verification of achievements*
   - A student can request confirmation of task completion
   - A teacher can confirm or reject the request
   - Information about the confirmation is recorded in the blockchain.

### 3. **Decentralized certificates*
   - After successful completion of the task, confirmation of achievement can be realized in one of two ways:
   - Sending a token to the student, which will serve as confirmation
   - Fixing information in the smart contract, where completion can be verified directly.

### 4. **Distribution of grants and scholarships through contract (additional functionality)*
   - A smart contract may contain conditions for automatic receipt of funds.
   - A teacher or mentor confirms the fulfillment of criteria.
   - A contract pays the grant or scholarship after verification.


## Additional functional requirements:
   - Integration with MetaMask or a similar wallet for authorization.
   - Frontend application for user interaction with the contract.

## Technical requirements:
   - The platform is based on Ethereum or Polygon.
   - Use of Solidity for creating smart contracts.
   - Repository on GitHub with a README that describes the installation and launch of the project, specifies the contract address and network.

## Expected result:
   - Implemented smart contract that allows students to submit applications for achievement confirmation.
   - Demonstration of the task confirmation mechanism and receipt of NFT certificates.

The presence of additional functionality is welcomed.For successful completion of the work, fulfilling the basic requirements will be sufficient, but fulfilling the additional ones will be a significant plus. The task is performed by a team.
